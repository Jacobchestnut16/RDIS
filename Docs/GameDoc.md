# About the project

For this project I focused on connecting the United States’ independence in 1776 and Haiti’s independence in 1804 by looking at how each event formed through documents, weapons, symbols, and political choices that shaped their outcomes. Both independence movements are major turning points in global history, but they happened for different reasons and created two very different definitions of freedom. The goal is to show how these revolutions relate to each other, where they differ, and how using artifacts inside a game environment can let players learn about the events without needing long text explanations.

The United States fought its revolution mainly over political rights and representation. The colonies argued that Britain violated their rights through taxes, trade control, and laws that did not include colonial approval. The Declaration of Independence is the strongest example of this argument. It laid out the reasoning behind breaking away from Britain and justified building a new government based on consent. Newspapers that printed the Declaration helped spread the message, unifying the colonies under the same idea. Weapons like Washington’s sword and the muskets used by the Continental Army represent the transition from protest to actual war. Early American flags show how the colonies started seeing themselves as a single nation instead of separate regions. The American independence movement was driven by political theory and debates about government structure, even though those debates did not extend equal rights to everyone living in the colonies at the time.

Haiti’s independence formed under a different situation altogether. Instead of resisting taxes or political restrictions, the people of Saint-Domingue were fighting to end slavery and the violence of the plantation system. The Haitian Revolution began as a massive uprising of enslaved people in 1791, and it expanded into a full-scale war against French forces. Leaders like Toussaint Louverture and Jean-Jacques Dessalines fought both militarily and politically to dismantle an economy built entirely on forced labor. The Haitian Declaration of Independence did more than break ties with France. It rejected slavery itself and established Haiti as the first Black republic in the world. Artifacts like cutlasses, captured French cannons, and the early Haitian flag highlight that their fight was not just about independence but survival and self-liberation. Their freedom came from overthrowing a racial hierarchy, not from negotiating political representation.

Both independence movements used strong documents to explain their purpose, relied on weapons and organized resistance, and created symbols to represent their new identity. Both overthrew European rule and shaped global ideas about freedom. But their differences matter. The American Revolution extended political participation mostly to white male property owners and kept many inequalities in place. Haiti’s revolution completely changed the social structure by ending slavery and creating a government led by people who had once been enslaved. The American Revolution was centered on political philosophy. Haiti’s was centered on human rights and the rejection of racial oppression. In global impact, the United States influenced later discussions about representative government, while Haiti challenged systems of slavery around the world, even though many nations tried to isolate it afterward.

Turning these events into a game built around artifacts allows players to learn through interaction instead of reading long historical summaries. When a player scans or picks up an object like the Declaration, the Haitian flag, a musket, or a pamphlet, they get a short narration explaining what the object represented during the revolution. This works almost like an immersive museum. Instead of talking about the history directly, the objects show how each independence movement formed, what people fought for, and why their choices mattered. It also gives a clearer contrast between the two independence days because the items themselves reveal what mattered most in each struggle.

The reason these artifacts work better in the game than long speeches is simple. Objects show the actions and conditions that drove both revolutions. They connect the player to a specific moment without overloading them with information. The narrations give enough context to understand the importance, but the item itself carries the meaning. The player learns by exploring, not by being lectured.

By comparing the United States and Haiti through these items, the game highlights how independence can mean different things depending on who is fighting and why. The Americans pursued political freedom from imperial control. The Haitians pursued human freedom from slavery. Both achieved independence, but the paths they took reflect two very different kinds of struggle. The artifact-based design supports this comparison by giving players a direct way to see and interact with the history instead of just reading about it.

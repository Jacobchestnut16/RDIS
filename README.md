# RDIS VR

RDIS VR is a Unity project that combines Doctor Who–inspired themes with historical exploration.

The experience focuses on key historical artifacts from the independence of the United States and Haiti. Players can explore two separate locations and view detailed recreations of historical relics up close.

Players move freely through each environment and interact with objects using the primary VR controller trigger, equivalent to a left click in the Meta XR Simulator. Interacting with an object plays a brief historical overview. The experience includes two maps, and players transition between them by walking into the blue box.

This project requires Unity 2023.3.62f3 and may require Blender for asset work.
